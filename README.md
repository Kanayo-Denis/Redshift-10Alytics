# Redshift-10Alytics
This is one of my projects on AWS Redshift.
The end goal of this project was to extract data from a publicly accessible bucket in AWS and perform an ETL process to transform the data from a staging area and generate an insightful report before loading it into a Data warehouse (AWS Redshift).
